# FRC-Downloader

FRC Downloader is a Powershell script designed to help you get software for FRC programming.

It is inspired by [CSA-USB-Tool](https://github.com/JamieSinn/CSA-USB-Tool)

# Getting Started

## Download as a Zip Then Expand

To get started, click `Clone or Download` in Github, followed by `Download Zip`.

Then expand the Zip file, such that there is a `Downloader.ps1` file viewable.

## Run Downloader.ps1

Right click on `Downloader.ps1` and click `Run With Powershell`. If this option is not visible, check with your system administrator if Powershell is enable on your computers.

## Wait

Once the script is run and a (usually blue) window appears, the downloading will begin.

A table will be shown at the top of the window with all of the software to be downloaded.

Once all software is downloaded, press any key to end the script.

## Install the Software

While this software downloads all of the necessary software, it can't install. Go through the installers to install the software.
